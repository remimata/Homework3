    <p>We are currently developping our web application PostIt !</p>
    <p>It allows people to add post to a page, some kind of social media but on post it notes.</p>
    <p>For now you can navigate threw the webpage, but the really important page is Main, you can add postIt, like others ones (or yours...) and reset the like count</p>
    <p>Thank you for using our application, we'll keep working on it and try to make it better with time !</p>
